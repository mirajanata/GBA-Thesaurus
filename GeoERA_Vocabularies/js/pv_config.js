        description: 'The HIKE project aims to support research and assessments of induced hazards and impacts that are related to the exploitation of subsurface resources and capacities throughout Europe. This will be achieved through development, demonstration and implementation of harmonized subsurface data sets and methodologies, investigation of applied use cases, and facilitation of knowledge shared between geological surveys and stakeholders. WP-2 focuses on the development of a European fault database covering a comprehensive set of static and dynamic geological and physical characteristics needed for the assessment of seismic hazards, ground movements, leakage and fluid migration, sealing capacities, fluid flow and other types of dynamic behaviour. This database will be developed, populated and tested in conjunction with several other GeoERA projects and external stakeholder involvement. WP-3 establishes novel hazard and impact research methods and investigates the added value of the established fault information in several case studies and geological settings across Europe. WP-4 concludes the research activities with future recommendations and the establishment of a share point for information, knowledge and preferred practices related to hazard and impact research. This share point is intended to provide a collaboration and knowledge exchange platform for future research by geological surveys and other stakeholders. WP-5 governs the embedding of the results into the GeoERA Information Platform.',

        description: 'The GeoConnect³d project develops and tests a new methodological approach to prepare and disclose geological information for policy support and subsurface management. The improved approach uses two regional case studies – the Roer-to-Rhine region and the Pannonian Basin. These regional, cross-border case studies are chosen to be complementary and sufficiently different in geological setting and degree of implementation of subsurface exploitation and management, in order to maximize their pan-European relevance. A novel bottom-up approach introduces two concepts that increase the geological understanding of an area and are aimed at providing a coherent geological context for evaluating subsurface applications and resolving subsurface management issues. The first new concept is the structural framework as a means of joining existing models of different scale and resolution to clarify the importance of planar structures in a way that makes the geology understandable to stakeholders involved in subsurface management. The second concept is that of geomanifestations. These specific expressions of geological processes are important sources of information for improving geological understanding. The structural framework models annotated with geomanifestations allow the integration and evaluation of complex cross-thematic research. The two bottom-up regional case studies form the study material for a top-down, more generic evaluation of potentially interacting subsurface activities that allows revisiting and refining state-of-the-art methods. Valorisation of regional results at pan-European level is ensured by testing the methodologies in two smaller pilot areas in Germany and Ireland.',

It needs to put all keywords used to tag datasets into a single hierarchy like a thesaurus. Data queries then can use this kind of a word net also to get search results for similar keywords within a semantic radius. For metadata descriptions, the clarification of the meaning of textual attributes applies mainly to keywords and the implementation of a semantic search within a metadata catalog. Here WP4 strives for a compilation (SKOS thesaurus) of keywords with URIs suitable for tagging metadata (-> use case: Multilingual Semantic Text Search).',
